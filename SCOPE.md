# Scope for the Whiteflag API

This Whiteflag Application Programming Interface (API) is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
software implementation of the API layer that provides an interface with the
Whiteflag messaging network on one or more underlying blockchains.

This Whiteflag API is a so called Minumum Viable Product (MVP). This means
that it only supports the core features of the Whiteflag protocol and
nothing more. The features that are considered in scope for this MVP API
are described below.

## In scope

### Message handling

The API should provide all message handling i.a.w. the standard:

* encoding/sending of all message types (v0.1)
* receiving/decoding of all message types (v0.1)
* syntax (v0.1) and reference (v0.3) checks of all message types
* encryption/decryption (v0.8)
* processing of test messages (v1.0) - issue #4
* checking for correct subject codes and object types (v1.0) - issue #13

### Blockchains

The API should demonstrate blockchain agnosticy of the protocol by
interfacing with the following blockchains:

* ethereum (v0.8)
* bitcoin (v1.0)
* fennel/polkadot (v1.1)

The API is able to read Whiteflag history from the blockchain into database.

### Message Indexing & Storage

To keep track of Whiteflag messages on the blockchain, the API should:

* perform storage of Whiteflag messages outside blockchain (v0.6)
* keep track of all references between messages (v0.3) and sequences (v0.5)
* keep track of block depth of Whiteflag messages (v0.9)

### Advanced Protocol Functionality

Advanced protocol features:

* Whiteflag authentication method 1 (signature-based):
  * create a Whiteflag digital signature (v0.7)
  * check against internet resource for `A1` messages (v0.8)
* Whiteflag authentication method 2 (token-based) (v1.0) - issue #3
* manage encryption keys for different originators:
  * pre-shared encryption keys (v0.9)
  * ECDH negotated encryption keys (v0.9)

### API functions

The API supports:

* basic http authorization (v0.8)
* native support for SSL (v0.9)

### Not implemented

The following functionality is in scope, but currently not implemented:

* message and area concatenation with reference code 3 - issue #2
* evaluation of message sequences

## Outside scope

### Protocol functionality

The following Whiteflag protocol features are not implemented:

* hierarchical deterministic keys and addresses

### API functionality

The API is not capable of:

* usage of the api by multiple users/originators
* advanced queries & filtering
